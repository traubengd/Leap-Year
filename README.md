# Leap-Year
This console application was the first exercise while learning programming and software development as part of the software engineering traineeship at Sogyo.

The application can be run through the JVM.

The application will request the user to enter a year of their choosing. Based on a set of rules defined, the application will subsequently tell the user whether the year entered is a leap year or not.
